Subject: [PATCH 052/375] arm64: Use full path in KBUILD_IMAGE definition

The KBUILD_IMAGE variable is used by the rpm and deb-pkg targets, which
expect it to point to the image file in the build directory. The
builddeb script has a workaround for architectures which only provide
the basename, but let's provide a clean interface for packaging tools.
